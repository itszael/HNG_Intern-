Hi

My name is Osaze Osaigbevo and i'm a beginner web developer.

I started learning not too long ago, became unserious about it for a while but i'm picking it up for the best this time.

I've always loved tech from quite a younger age. Surprisingly, i got my first computer in 20** but just did the normal regular computing work on it.

But right now, i really want to do tech. And i promise myself to put in the very best effort. I do know it is going to be challenging along the way.

Putting my feet on the gas, i know i'll sclale through and help make the world a safer and better place.
